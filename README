Introduction
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"confFoam" is a "common configuration package" for the realted OpenFOAM (Open
Source CFD Toolbox, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/foam/ ) developement. 
The neccessity for defintion of such kind of functionality appears from the
issue that OpenFOAM referece build system does not provide corresponding
capabilities. As result of lack of the configuration capabilties OpenFOAM
users/developers strugle with compilation procidure trying to discover reasons
for this or that failure.

"confFoam" proposed implementation based on standard Linux/UNIX "GNU automake"
tools. This set of tools allow users adjust the environment they are going to
use for compilation of sources and check, wheter everything is correct, before
starting actual compilation. As result, users become aware of the all
prerequisites needed to compile the given sources and directly informed if
something is wrong.
